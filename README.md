# Catch & Share - Capstone-Project
Capstone Project of neuefische GmbH WebDev Bootcamp

! This WebApp is currently in a WIP state and not ready for production. !

<br>

### About
> The WebApp is called Catch & Share and will be an App for anglers/fisherman to share their catches on a map by just clicking on the current location of the catch. <br>
They can share/manage/update/delete all informations around the catch that can be interesting for other anglers/fisherman like daytime, fish, length, weight, bait, depth, tackle etc. <br>
Further, if enough people share their catches the whole data could be interesting for research programms about fish, for instance if a new hydropower plant prevent fish from migrating. 

<br>

### Used Technologies
> - React with Vite.js for the frontend 
> - Express.js for the backend, further mongoose to handle the db
> - MongoDB as db
> - Google API for map, places, geocode, geolocate
> - any free weather API, not decided yet
